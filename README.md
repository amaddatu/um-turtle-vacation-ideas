## if i wanted to delete the models Tech and MatchUp, what files do I have to look at?

### Server Side

Model files
typedefs
resolvers
seed.js
servers.js

### React Side

mutations.js
queries.js
component that uses MatchUp/Tech queries
component that uses MatchUp/Tech mutations
look at Routes that use the MatchUp/Tech ids
homepage should work without MatchUp/Tech Home.js
